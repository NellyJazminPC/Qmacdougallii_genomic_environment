# Structure of the `/data/` folder


**(IN PROCESS UNTIL PUBLICATION)**

This directory will contain the genomic data until the publication of the scientific paper.


At the moment, in this folder you can find the VCF file, called `** var.79.inds.sorted.vcf **`. which contains 8,186 SNPs identified for the 79 individuals analyzed in the work of [Pacheco-Cruz, 2019](http://oreon.dgbiblio.unam.mx/F/X3YHJ1BNV7S4YYHEPDPIIA1S4GF2I5UGQMS61QGRFB4AHKPCJ7-04791?func=full-set-set&set_number=023823&set_entry=000002&format=999).


What's next:

The objective is to use the raw sequencing data and add in bin the scripts used for cleaning and filtering, as well as for the assembly and identification of SNPs (VCF file), using the Stacks, iPyrad and bwa-freebayes pipelines.
