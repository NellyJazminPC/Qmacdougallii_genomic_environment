# Functional genomic variation and its association with environmental variables in *Quercus macdougallii*



### Temperate forests

Temperate forests are important **reservoirs of biomass and biodiversity**, in addition to **providing ecological services** and being an indisputable part of the **biocultural heritage** of humankind [(Gil-Pelegrín *et al.,* 2017)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-69099-5).


### Oaks

The *Quercus* genus, also known as oaks, is one of the most important groups in the forest ecosystems of the northern hemisphere [(Cavender-Bares, 2016)](https://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/cbs.umn.edu/files/public/downloads/2016.cavender.journal.ios%2327.pdf). Currently, Mexico is the main center of diversification of the *Quercus* genus (approx. 150 spp.), of which about half (76 spp.) are endemic to the country ([Valencia, 2004](https://www.botanicalsciences.com.mx/index.php/botanicalSciences/article/view/1692); [Romero-Rangel *et al.,* 2015](https://www.internationaloaksociety.org/content/encinos-de-mexico-new-book-about-mexican-oaks-spanish-0)).

This great diversity and endemism represent an important area of opportunity for studies of adaptation in long-lived tree species to environmental variables in the face of climate change, especially since their ability to face rapid environmental changes can indicate functional processes essential for their survival, being an ideal setting for functional genomics studies ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/); [Naidoo *et al.,* 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00273/full)).

### *Quercus macdougallii*

The oak *Quercus macdougallii* Martínez is an **endangered** ([IUCN, 2020](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/32765/2823034)) and **threatened** ([DOF, 2019](http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5578808&fecha=14/11/2019)) **endemic** species, which has a distribution restricted to the Sierra Juárez also known as Sierra Norte de Oaxaca ([Valencia, 2004](https://www.botanicalsciences.com.mx/index.php/botanicalSciences/article/view/1692); [Romero-Rangel *et al.,* 2015](https://www.internationaloaksociety.org/content/encinos-de-mexico-new-book-about-mexican-oaks-spanish-0)), and whose populations they maintain a binomial distribution with altitudinal selection ([Anacleto-Carmona, 2015](http://www.unsij.edu.mx/tesis/)).

Some studies have reported that at an ecological level this species has a low population number and survival problems, in addition its populations face events of anthropic disturbance (*i.e.*, deforestation and land-use change) and natural (fires and frosts) ([Anacleto-Carmona, 2015](http://www.unsij.edu.mx/tesis/); [Pariona *et al.,* 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969716320575); [Clark-Tapia *et al.,* 2018](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1405-04712018000200217)). At genetic level, a low variation has been reported through the analysis of three nuclear microsatellites, possibly due to a bottleneck effect (Molina-Garay, 2011).

Recently, genomic variation has been analyzed from 8,186 *SNPs* (**single nucleotide polymorphisms**, [more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOUkLiYrKEo)) and the current and future potential distribution under climate change scenarios for *Q. macdougallii* along its known distribution in the municipalities Ixtlán de Juárez , Santiago Comaltepec and San Pedro Yolox, identifying a possible genetic group with incipient structuring, as well as *outliers SNPs* (**_SNPs_ with high differentiation values**) associated with the area located in Ixtlán, which the future distribution model suggests will face drastic changes in its environmental conditions in the next 30 and 50 years ([Pacheco-Cruz, 2019](http://oreon.dgbiblio.unam.mx/F/X3YHJ1BNV7S4YYHEPDPIIA1S4GF2I5UGQMS61QGRFB4AHKPCJ7-04791?func=full-set-set&set_number=023823&set_entry=000002&format=999)).

A high specificity to certain environmental conditions such as soil type has also been detected, since the species is only found in two types, which are only present in 0.5% (humic acrisol) and 2.4% (vertic luvisol) in the Mexican territory, which highlights the high specificity of this endemic species ([WRB, 2015](http://www.fao.org/3/i3794es/I3794es.pdf); [Pacheco-Cruz, 2019](http://oreon.dgbiblio.unam.mx/F/X3YHJ1BNV7S4YYHEPDPIIA1S4GF2I5UGQMS61QGRFB4AHKPCJ7-04791?func=full-set-set&set_number=023823&set_entry=000002&format=999)).

### Functional genomics and environment

The increasing availability of **genomic information** for the *Quercus* genus has allowed increasing the investigation of the relationships between functional genomics and environmental variables by exploring local adaptation in candidate genes ([Rellstab *et al.,* 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13889); [Sork *et al.,* 2016a](https://www.g3journal.org/content/6/11/3485.short); [Sork *et al.,* 2016b](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1500162); [Gugger *et al.,* 2017](https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article/37/5/632/2731788); [Pina-Martins *et al.,* 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14497)). For example, the first work on genomic variation associated with climate has recently been published for an oak that is distributed in Mexico, *Q. rugosa*. In this work 5,354 SNPs were identified and from a landscape genomics approach a strong association was found between the pattern of genetic variation and the seasonality of precipitation ([Martins *et al.,* 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.12684)).

The investigation of **functional genomic variation** allows the identification of genes whose function could be linked to aspects of **growth**, **development**, **differentiation** and **defense** in plants ([Müller and Gailing, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/plb.13008)). Studying the **association of these candidate genes with environmental variables**, such as temperature, precipitation and soil ([Müller and Gailing, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/plb.13008); [Yang *et al.,* 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.01534/full)) can help to improve the understanding of the genetic expression of the species, of its adaptive genetics variation and the responses of their populations to a changing climate. Likewise, these investigations can contribute to improve the conservation plans of species highly restricted and with specific requirements for their growth, permanence and survival, such as **_Q. macdougallii_**.

## Hypothesis

In long-lived tree species, genes associated with an adaptive response to climatic changes have been reported, therefore, it is expected that *Q. macdougallii*, an endemic oak, will present genes associated with environmental variables, such as temperature, precipitation and soil.
