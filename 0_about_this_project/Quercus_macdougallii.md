# Functional genomic variation and its association with environmental variables in *Quercus macdougallii*


### Temperate forests

Temperate forests are important **reservoirs of biomass and biodiversity**, in addition to **providing ecological services** and being an indisputable part of the **biocultural heritage** of humankind [(Gil-Pelegrín *et al.,* 2017)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-69099-5).

### Oaks

The *Quercus* genus, also known as oaks, is one of the most important groups in the forest ecosystems of the northern hemisphere [(Cavender-Bares, 2016)](https://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/cbs.umn.edu/files/public/downloads/2016.cavender.journal.ios%2327.pdf). Currently, Mexico is the main center of diversification of the *Quercus* genus (approx. 150 spp.), of which about half (76 spp.) are endemic to the country ([Valencia, 2004](https://www.botanicalsciences.com.mx/index.php/botanicalSciences/article/view/1692); [Romero-Rangel *et al.,* 2015](https://www.internationaloaksociety.org/content/encinos-de-mexico-new-book-about-mexican-oaks-spanish-0)).

This great diversity and endemism represent an important area of opportunity for studies of adaptation in long-lived tree species to environmental variables in the face of climate change, especially since their ability to face rapid environmental changes can indicate functional processes essential for their survival, being an ideal setting for functional genomics studies ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/); [Naidoo *et al.,* 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00273/full)).

### *Quercus macdougallii*

The oak *Quercus macdougallii* Martínez (1963), also known as *Yaa dua yu* (Zapoteco) and *’Ma kue* (Chinanteco) is an **endangered** ([IUCN, 2020](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/32765/2823034)) and **threatened** ([DOF, 2019](http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5578808&fecha=14/11/2019)) **endemic** species, which has a distribution restricted to the Sierra Juárez also known as Sierra Norte de Oaxaca ([Valencia, 2004](https://www.botanicalsciences.com.mx/index.php/botanicalSciences/article/view/1692); [Romero-Rangel *et al.,* 2015](https://www.internationaloaksociety.org/content/encinos-de-mexico-new-book-about-mexican-oaks-spanish-0)), and whose populations they maintain a binomial distribution with altitudinal selection ([Anacleto-Carmona, 2015](http://www.unsij.edu.mx/tesis/)).

Some studies have reported that at an ecological level this species has a low population number and survival problems, in addition its populations face events of anthropic disturbance (*i.e.*, deforestation and land-use change) and natural (fires and frosts) ([Anacleto-Carmona, 2015](http://www.unsij.edu.mx/tesis/); [Pariona *et al.,* 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969716320575); [Clark-Tapia *et al.,* 2018](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1405-04712018000200217)). At genetic level, a low variation has been reported through the analysis of three nuclear microsatellites, possibly due to a bottleneck effect (Molina-Garay, 2011).

Recently, genomic variation has been analyzed from 8,186 *SNPs* (**single nucleotide polymorphisms**, [more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOUkLiYrKEo)) and the current and future potential distribution under climate change scenarios for *Q. macdougallii* along its known distribution in the municipalities Ixtlán de Juárez , Santiago Comaltepec and San Pedro Yolox, identifying a possible genetic group with incipient structuring, as well as *outliers SNPs* (**_SNPs_ with high differentiation values**) associated with the area located in Ixtlán, which the future distribution model suggests will face drastic changes in its environmental conditions in the next 30 and 50 years ([Pacheco-Cruz, 2019](http://oreon.dgbiblio.unam.mx/F/X3YHJ1BNV7S4YYHEPDPIIA1S4GF2I5UGQMS61QGRFB4AHKPCJ7-04791?func=full-set-set&set_number=023823&set_entry=000002&format=999)).

A high specificity to certain environmental conditions such as soil type has also been detected, since the species is only found in two types, which are only present in 0.5% (humic acrisol) and 2.4% (vertic luvisol) in the Mexican territory, which highlights the high specificity of this endemic species ([WRB, 2015](http://www.fao.org/3/i3794es/I3794es.pdf); [Pacheco-Cruz, 2019](http://oreon.dgbiblio.unam.mx/F/X3YHJ1BNV7S4YYHEPDPIIA1S4GF2I5UGQMS61QGRFB4AHKPCJ7-04791?func=full-set-set&set_number=023823&set_entry=000002&format=999)).

### Functional genomics and environment

The increasing availability of **genomic information** for the *Quercus* genus has allowed increasing the investigation of the relationships between functional genomics and environmental variables by exploring local adaptation in candidate genes ([Rellstab *et al.,* 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13889); [Sork *et al.,* 2016a](https://www.g3journal.org/content/6/11/3485.short); [Sork *et al.,* 2016b](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1500162); [Gugger *et al.,* 2017](https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article/37/5/632/2731788); [Pina-Martins *et al.,* 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14497)). For example, the first work on genomic variation associated with climate has recently been published for an oak that is distributed in Mexico, *Q. rugosa*. In this work 5,354 SNPs were identified and from a landscape genomics approach a strong association was found between the pattern of genetic variation and the seasonality of precipitation ([Martins *et al.,* 2018](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.b56tm0t)).

The investigation of **functional genomic variation** allows the identification of genes whose function could be linked to aspects of **growth**, **development**, **differentiation** and **defense** in plants ([Müller and Gailing, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/plb.13008)). Studying the **association of these candidate genes with environmental variables**, such as temperature, precipitation and soil ([Müller and Gailing, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/plb.13008); [Yang *et al.,* 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.01534/full)) can help to improve the understanding of the genetic expression of the species, of its adaptive genetics variation and the responses of their populations to a changing climate. Likewise, these investigations can contribute to improve the conservation plans of species highly restricted and with specific requirements for their growth, permanence and survival, such as **_Q. macdougallii_**.

## Hypothesis

- In long-lived tree species, genes associated with an adaptive response to climatic changes have been reported, therefore, it is expected that *Q. macdougallii*, an endemic oak, will present genes associated with environmental variables, such as temperature, precipitation and soil.

## Materials and methods

The study area is located in the Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca, in three municipalities, San Pedro Yolox, Santiago Comaltepec, and Ixtlán de Juárez. Considering eight sampling sites in its known distribution (approximately 28 km), five sites in the northern zone, and three in the southern zone.

In the work of [Pacheco-Cruz (2019)](http://oreon.dgbiblio.unam.mx/F/X3YHJ1BNV7S4YYHEPDPIIA1S4GF2I5UGQMS61QGRFB4AHKPCJ7-04791?func=full-set-set&set_number=023823&set_entry=000002&format=999), the genomic variation at the population level and the potential distribution of the species were analyzed considering these same sampling sites and 80 individuals collected. From the massive sequencing based on the **Sequence-based genotyping** (SBG, [for more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpcM45HpcMU)) method, 700,000 readings were obtained per individual.

The following analyzes will be carried out from this massive sequencing data set as well as the georeferencing data of each of its individuals collected.

From the sequencing data set [Pacheco-Cruz (2019)](http://oreon.dgbiblio.unam.mx/F/X3YHJ1BNV7S4YYHEPDPIIA1S4GF2I5UGQMS61QGRFB4AHKPCJ7-04791?func=full-set-set&set_number=023823&set_entry=000002&format=999), *outliers SNPs* will be identified between the two distribution zones of *Q. macdougallii*, north and south, by using bioinformatics programs such as [Stacks](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/), [FreeBayes](https://bioinformaticsworkbook.org/dataAnalysis/VariantCalling/freebayes-dnaseq-workflow.html#gsc.tab=0), [Bayescan](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/BayeScan/) and the packages of [adegenet](http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/files/tutorial-basics.pdf) and [snpstats](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/snpStats.html) in R ([Caldu-Primo *et al.,* 2017](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.j2n8q); [Martins *et al.,* 2018](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.b56tm0t); [Pina-Martins *et al.,* 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14497)).

Afterwards, the variations found in coding areas will be identified and separated, using two approaches: 

- First, to determine the position of the candidate *SNPs*, a gene model based on the *Q. lobata* genome will be used ([Sork *et al.,* 2016a](https://www.g3journal.org/content/6/11/3485.short)) and its transcriptome ([Cokus *et al.,* 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-015-1761-4)), through the [BEDTools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [GMAP](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/21/9/1859/409207) and [Sim4db](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/27/13/1869/185389) programs.

- The second approach will be using a set of genes previously identified in the literature ([Rellstab *et al.,* 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13889)) and obtained from public databases (*e.g.* [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [Quercus Portal](https://quercusportal.pierroton.inra.fr/), [Hardwood Genomics Project and Oak Genome Sequencing](https://www.hardwoodgenomics.org/)).


To evaluate the environmental variables in the study area that will be used for multivariate analyzes, databases will be analyzed at the national ([CONABIO](http://www.conabio.gob.mx/informacion/gis/) and [CONAGUA](https://www.gob.mx/conagua)) and international ([World Clim](https://www.worldclim.org/)) levels through the [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html), [QGIS](https://qgis.org/es/site/) and R programs.


For the analysis of the soil variables, soil samples will be collected in spring (april) and autumn (september) of 2021 and 2022. Two soil cores (10 cm diameter and 5 cm depth) will be taken from horizon A (upper layer soil), within the first and last plot of the transect of each site, with 32 samples in total. Physicochemical properties will be determined, such as nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) content, the C:N ratio, the pH, and the moisture content ([Schmidt *et al.,* 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112714006872)).

Then, correlation analyzes will be performed between the identified *SNPs* and the selected environmental variables using multivariate models such as Gradient Forest and the Generalized Modeling of Dissimilarity in R ([Fitzpatrick and Keller, 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12376); [Martins *et al.,* 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.12684)).

The *SNPs* in genes that present a high association with the analyzed variables will be selected as candidates for local adaptation and to evaluate their differential expression, plant material (leaves) will be collected from individuals for mRNA extraction (TRIzol and RNeasy). Likewise, specific primers will be designed using the [Primer 3 v0.4](http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/primer3plus/primer3plus.cgi/) program. Then, the gene expression profile information will be analyzed using the qPCR (quantitative PCR, [for more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kvy17ugI4w)) technique .

Finally, depending on the number of genes associated with environmental variables that are analyzed, a possible model of their differential expression will be built ([Ay and Arnosti, 2011](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10409238.2011.556597)) for *Q. macdougallii*.
 
## Relevance and impact of the project

This work will constitute the first step to study the local adaptation in candidate genes associated with certain environmental variables in natural populations of an oak endemic to Mexico. This could help to detect geographic patterns of functional genomic variation and improve conservation plans for the species. In addition, for the area of ecology and evolutionary biology, this project is an opportunity to identify evolutionary processes that could be affecting the genomic variation of this endemic species and its local adaptation, which can serve as a reference for future studies of oaks endemic to Oaxaca and Mexico, given its importance as the second forest group in Mexico and as an axis group of the temperate forests of the country.

This project is close to what goal 15 of [The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/es/) proposed by the United Nations (UN).
Because the information generated in this project is expected to help in the management of forests in a sustainable way and stop the loss of biodiversity that can occur due to lack of information on key species in the functioning of ecosystems.

Also, given that this oak tree is located in an area where indigenous communities try to conserve the biodiversity of their forests and at the same time maintain sustainable forest management, it is important to promote multidisciplinary projects in order to increase the capacity for planning and effective management in relation to the management and conservation plans in the face of climate change, as proposed in Goal 13.b of the SDG.
